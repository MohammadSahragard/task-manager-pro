# Taskato
Access my site at [taskato.vercel.app](https://taskato.vercel.app)

### About the app
Taskato is a personal work sample for my resume. You can create an account and use it to create tasks and notes for yourself. You can create a task and set its due date, reminder date, and also create sub-tasks for it. Categorize your tasks with custom lists you created and update or delete those lists whenever you want.<br>
#### Challenges I faced for the first time:
- Working with MongoDB databases professionally
- Building real APIs and working with back-end
- Using TypeScript in a relatively large program
